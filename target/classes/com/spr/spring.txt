Spring → framework
IoC Container → part of Spring that actually does the work

Spring is a dependency injection framework which makes java application loosly coupled.

spring ke pass jo IOC container oh sara kaam kar ke dega


A Bean or spring bean is an object, and that object is created and managed by the Spring IoC container.

it automatically means:
created by Spring IoC container
managed by Spring IoC container

Spring cannot do this without the IoC container.

A Spring Bean is an object, 
and that object is created, configured, and managed by the Spring IoC container.

IoC Container is a Spring component that creates, manages, and injects objects 
instead of the programmer doing it manually.
IOC container->Inversion of control -->work
1. create object
2. hold it in memory
3. inject in another class


What is IoC Container? (In very simple words)
👉 IoC = Inversion of Control
Normally in Java:
You create objects using new
You control when and how objects are created


But in Spring:
Spring creates the objects
Spring manages them
Spring gives them to you when needed
This idea is called Inversion of Control (control is inverted from you → Spring).


type of IOC Container
1. BeanFactory ---> BeanFactory just gives objects when requested. Nothing extra
                    BeanFactory is a basic IoC container

2. ApplicationContext
